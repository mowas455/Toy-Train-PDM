# Toy-Train-PDM

The problem you should solve is to predict the gyro yaw ten steps into the future. You are
free to use any ML-library and programming language that you like but you are not allowed to
use a workbench e.g. Knime since programming will be a daily activity for you. Donâ€™t use Long
short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks to solve the problem.
